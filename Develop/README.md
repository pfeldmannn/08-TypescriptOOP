## 08 Typescript Object Oriented Programming

### Description
For this challenge I updated a Typescript command-line application that allows the user to create either a car, truck or motorbike or choose an existing vehicle type. If the user decides to create a new vehicle the application will have them input that vehicles color, make, model, year, and top speed. Once the new vehicle is created or an exhisting one is selected the user will be able to perform actions with the vehicle. The user will be able to perform actions with the car until they decide to exit the command-line. 

### Usage 
Here is a walkthrough video on how to use this application.
